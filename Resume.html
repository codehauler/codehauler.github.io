<B><P>MAJOR PROJECTS</B></P>
</H2>
<DIR>
<P><a href="http://www.apple.com/music">iTunes Music Store</a> was a radically new way of purchasing music online.  My responsibilities included initial architecture of a pluggable content-importation tool for music (samples, metadata, cover art, the works), and an implementation of same for the Warner label; later I was responsible for design and implementation of the commerce model, credit-card authorization engine, integration with SAP, commerce UI implementation, and price modelling.  After the initial release I was responsible for the commerce and much of the account UI components of 20+ and counting international stores, complete UI and architecture of a gift certificate/allowance mechanism, as well as a more recent mechanism for gifting music (patent pending).  Throughout the project I was a principal architect and design leader.  The iTunes Music Store has been Apple's most successful online venture, and the most successful online music store in the world to date.</P>

<P><a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork">iWork</a>.  Apple's productivity client applications for iOS and MacOS.  Monolithic codebase, large numbers of developers, high levels of integration between subsystems.  I wrote network integration layers, and syncing UI; it was a great way to get refreshed on modern iOS/MacOS X client APIs and practice.
<P><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunesu">iTunes U</a>.  Apple's e-learning solution.  My involvement was mainly back-end data management and database integration.</P>
<P><a href="http://www.mac.com">.Mac</a>.  A suite of internet applications that provide Apple customers with the ability to painlessly enhance their internet experience.  I was responsible for the design and implementation of the e-commerce underpinnings of the free iTools service's transition to the subscription-based .Mac service, particularly in the area of credit card processing, commerce UI, and SAP integration.</P>
<P><a href="http://areaj.org">AreaJ</a>.  An open-source perl/mod_perl/mysql/apache/ImageMagick based suite of web applications for management, presentation, and editing of digital photographs.</P>
<P>Designer of a CORBA/java based object-management middleware solution for <a href="http://www.resonate.com/">Resonate</a>'s second-generation product.  Can't say more until the product is available.</P>

<P>Maintenance and new versions of Oracle's AWT and Swing-based Table objects; design and implementation of localized calendar UI object, Design and implementation of GanttChart UI object.</P>

<P>Infoscape FrescoDesigner versions 1.0 thru 3.x, and Fresco Frameworks.  Infoscape’s FrescoDesigner is a complete database front-end solution, including tools for object-relational mapping, GUI layout and connection, as well as frameworks for complex database access. (1997, 1998).</P>

<P>Solaris Openstep.  Sun’s implementation of the OpenStep Spec developed jointly by Sun and NeXT.  Openstep included a fully-featured application-development library that implements the NEXTSTEP look-and-feel, as well as the basic productivity apps such as a mail application and text editor.  My work on Openstep included integration of new application-kit code, porting of NeXT's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/enterprise/WebObjects/Reference/Frameworks/ObjC/EOF/EnterpriseObjects.html"> Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF)</a>, bug-fixing of existing code (mostly mail-related) and design and implementation of large parts of the sound subsystem. (1996).  OpenStep and NextStep have since evolved into Apple's upcoming <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/server/">Mac OS X 'Rhapsody'</a> Operating System.</P>


<P>McCaw Application Framework.  This object-to-database persistence effort was an augmentation of NeXT’s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/enterprise/WebObjects/Reference/Frameworks/ObjC/EOF/EnterpriseObjects.html"> Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF)</a>.  As part of a team of about 10 engineers, my responsibilities were to design, develop, fix, and maintain the GUI architecture and tools, including InterfaceBuilder palettes, re-usable interface objects, user-input validation subsystem, and GUI-side database interface code.  Also was solely responsible for development and delivery of SecurityManager a table-maintenance application managing a complex schema.  (1995).</P>

<P>MSMail Bundle.  This is a bundle designed for use with NEXTSTEP 3.3’s Mail.app, providing the capability to send and receive Microsoft-format Mail.  (1994).</P>

<P>TTools.  A library/IB-palette combination designed as an advanced IB primer, released as a NeXT mini-example for the use of the NEXTSTEP developer community.  (1993).  Related speaking engagements at the East Coast Developer Conference, NEXTSTEP Expo and a feature article on IB-palette development for the NeXT-produced developer journal, NXApp (1993, 1994).</P>

<P>NeXT Premium Team Support.  I designed and field-tested the delivery of a team support policy for NeXT’s Premium Developer Support customers, so that I was able to return to school part-time to finish my degree (1993).</P>

<P>NeXTAnswers faxback software (team effort), a utility package that collates multiple documents in many formats, converts to PostScript, and faxes the result.  In production as the back-end of the NeXTAnswers document-retrieval system (1993).</P>

<P>MeetingPlace.  A NEXTSTEP group decision support system application.  Helped design and implement a coordinated, multimedia object-sharing architecture for UBC’s Commerce Department (1992).</P>

<P>FUBAR: Fully Unified Basic Appointment Resource.  (Code Name).  A
UNIX/X11 application allowing individuals and groups to organize and
integrate their schedules across a LAN.  (1990, 1991).</P>
